# find-in-table
A quickly done chrome extension to find two cells (one with username and one with the email) with the same value.

## TODO
1. `background.js` to detect `chrome.iddle.queryState`, and if time is > 5mins, play elevator music.
2. `popup.html` + `popup.js` to develop the date comparing logic.
